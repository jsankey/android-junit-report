Android JUnit Report Test Runner
================================

Introduction
------------

The Android JUnit report test runner is a custom instrumentation test
runner for Android that creates XML test reports.  These reports are
in a similar format to those created by the Ant JUnit task's XML
formatter, allowing them to be integrated with tools that support that
format (e.g. continuous integration servers).

Quick Start
-----------

This is a quick overview of how to integrate the runner with Ant
builds. Note all modifications are made to your test project, i.e. the
project which implements the JUnit tests:

  * Grab the latest jar from:
      http://github.com/jsankey/android-junit-report/downloads
    and add it to your libs/ directory.
  * Edit AndroidManifest.xml to set android:name in the
    <instrumentation> tag to:
      com.zutubi.android.junitreport.JUnitReportTestRunner.
  * Edit ant.properties to add the line:
      test.runner=com.zutubi.android.junitreport.JUnitReportTestRunner
  * Run your tests as you would normally:
      $ ant debug install test
  * Pull the resulting XML report from the device (from the application
    under test's internal storage directory):
      $ adb pull /data/data/<main app package>/files/junit-report.xml
  * Integrate the XML with your chosen build tool.
  
Customising Via Arguments
-------------------------

The runner supports the following arguments:

  * reportFile: name of the file(s) to write the XML report to (default:
    junit-report.xml or junit-report-__suite__.xml depending on the value of
    multiFile).  May contain __suite__, which will be replaced with the test
    suite name when using multiFile mode.  See the reportDir argument for
    discussion of the file location.
  * reportDir: if specified, absolute path to a directory in which to write
    the report file(s).  May begin with __external__, which will be replaced
    with the path for the external storage area of the application under
    test.  This requires external storage to be available and
    WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission in the application under test
    (default: unset, in which case files are written to the internal storage
    area of the application under test).
  * multiFile: if true, write a separate XML file for each test suite;
    otherwise include all suites in a single XML file (default: false).
  * filterTraces: if true, stack traces in test failure reports will be
    filtered to remove noise such as framework methods (default: true)

To specify arguments, use the -e flag to adb shell am instrument, for
example:

adb shell am instrument -w -e reportFile my-report.xml \
  com.example.test/com.zutubi.android.junitreport.JUnitReportTestRunner

See the example and/or full documentation for how to set arguments in
you Ant build.

More Information
----------------

Check out the following resources for more details:

  * The project home page (with full documentation):

  * The example project in the example/ subdirectory.

Building From Source
--------------------

If you would like to modify the runner, or build it yourself for any
other reason, you will need:

  * A JDK, version 1.5 or later.
  * The Android SDK (or at least a stub android.jar as provided in the
    SDK).
  * Apache Ant version 1.7 or later.

To run a build:

  * Create a file local.properties in the directory containing this
    README.  In this file, define the location of an android.jar to
    build against, for example:

    android.jar=/opt/android/platforms/android-14/android.jar

    where /opt/android is the root of an Android SDK.

  * Run ant in this same directory:

    $ ant

The jar will be created at build/android-junit-report-dev.jar.
